## Notes About This Project

- This project was assigned as part of my apprenticeship with Creating Coding Careers, where I am currently learning about React.
- After completeing the main requirements for this project, which you can view on my main branch, I wanted to add some personal flair to the project, with clarity, consistency, and scalability in mind.
- I faced a decent amount of challenges with this project. Specifically with getting the **amortization schedule** to populate on the form like I wanted. I think I have it to a point where I am happy with the overall state of the project and ready to move on to my next one!
